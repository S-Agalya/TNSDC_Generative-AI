# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Synthetic Data Generation

## Overview
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic data samples based on the provided dataset. The GAN consists of a generator network that produces synthetic data samples and a discriminator network that distinguishes between real and synthetic data. During training, the generator learns to generate synthetic samples that resemble the distribution of the real data, while the discriminator learns to accurately classify between real and fake samples.

## Dataset
The provided dataset consists of multiple CSV files:
- `imgs_2023071012130978799.csv`: Contains information about load and ES modes.
- `imgs_202307101549519358.csv`: Contains information about energy and w.
- `imgs_2023071012133740345.csv`: Contains information about energy.
- `imgs_2023071012123392536.csv`: Contains information about BS, CellName, RUType, Mode, Frequency, Bandwidth, Antennas, and TXpower.

## Preprocessing
The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and normalize numerical features. The preprocessing step ensures that the data is suitable for training the GAN.

## Training
The GAN is trained using the preprocessed dataset. During training, the generator and discriminator networks are optimized using the binary cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer. The training process involves iteratively updating the weights of the generator and discriminator networks to minimize the loss functions.

## Generating Synthetic Data
Once the GAN is trained, synthetic data samples can be generated by feeding random noise into the generator network. The generated synthetic data resembles the distribution of the real data and can be used for various downstream tasks such as data augmentation, anomaly detection, or exploratory data analysis.
